## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on

## Syntax:
##
##      user    MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.
##
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Same thing without a password
%wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
